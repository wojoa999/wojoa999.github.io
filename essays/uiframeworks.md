## My Experience with UI Frameworks

Over the past few weeks, I have become familiar with UI Frameworks using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5. I am a complete newbie with all of these frameworks, so my outlook may differ with someone who has experience with the frameworks. For me it seemed like a whole new programming language that needed to be learned. The use of classes was a new experience that was easily picked up on. In this essay, I discuss my experiences in the usage of UI frameworks.  

Overall, with being new to the frameworks experience I did enjoy working with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5. After the completion of a few experiences or WODs, I was able to get a grasp on using UI Frameworks. While there is still much to learn, I now feel more confident working with frameworks. I am looking forward to learning much more and how I can expand my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5.
