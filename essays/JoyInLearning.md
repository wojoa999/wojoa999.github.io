While in grade school, I never really understood or enjoyed the aspect of learning. I only accomplished what was needed to pass and moved on to the next course. It wasn't until years after I graduated high school that I took a strong interest in learing. Throughout my studies in computer and electrical engineering, I was able to learn about everyday devices that we take for granted. 

My studies have now brought me to the subject of software engineering. During my time this semester, I want to hone my skills in programming. I consider myself a strong math and engineering student, but where I lack is my programming skills. I wish to take all of the bits of programming I have learned and finnally piece the parts together to solve problems. A key piece I would love to learn is having the vision to not only solve a problem, but solve it in a way that can be applied to multiple problems. 

What I want to take away from software engineering is the ability to learn the basics, so I can advance my studies to the next course. I'm not totally sure what the future holds in this course, but I do know that every piece is important. While it may not seem important not, I just know that I will cross paths with what is currently being taught. That is the power in learning.
