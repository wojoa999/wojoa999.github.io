## ESLint
  Over the past week, I have been working with VSCode and ESLint. The initial setup of ESLint gave me the biggest issues. I struggled with installing ESLint onto my MacBook, but the installation of NVM gave no issues. Upon installing ESLint, I was receiving a ton of errors on my terminal. The terminal gave me the command to fix the errors, but they seemed to be neverending. After thinking that ESLint was properly installed, I was not receiving any errors that I was expecting. It took a few attempts of running through the tutorial before I was able to get ESLint to work. Ever since, my ESLint has been working properly and I have not received any further issues.  
  Initially using ESLint, I really enjoyed getting feedback on the coding errors I was receiving. It wasn’t until a few assignments later that I realised how particular the coding errors became. For instance, I cannot use my tab key to indent while working in a for loop. The coding standard uses two spaces as an indentation. This becomes extremely annoying when trying to code. After I finish my code, I have to go back and respace just about all of my lines to the correct spacing. At times, the error for spacing and new lines becomes confusing. For example, after the code is finished you must enter a new line otherwise you will receive an error. 
  On the opposite side of ESLint the feedback for errors in your code are very useful and don’t leave you looking through code to figure out your issue. It will even go as far as saying what the issue is and how to fix it. A feature that I have been enjoying to combat the spacing issue and other simple issues is the quick fix. This allows all of the minor issues to be fixed in seconds. For instance, if you initialize a variable using let and never change the value. ESLint will throw an error, but within the error it will tell you to change the variable to a constant due to the value not changing. 
  Besides the setup and minor spacing errors, I have been enjoying my time using ESLint. This setup makes the debugging aspect of coding simpler and quicker. The best feature, for me, is the comments on how to fix the errors within the code. Using ESLint has been a new change to my programming that I have seemed to grow upon. I am looking forward to learning and using ESLint more throughout this semester.
