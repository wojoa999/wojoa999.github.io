The purpose of the this project was to automate the irrigation system for watering crops. The team wanted to make watering crops more efficient by creating a system that would allow the water schedule to be monitored over the phone or computer rather than manually checking. A new system would allow the team to track the moisture in the ground, track weather, and check the pressure just by checking thier mobile device. The central valves are another key area the automation has a focus on. This would allow the central valves to be opened and closed remotely. Reducing the need for employess to have to come into work over the weekend to shut off valves if there is a break or water leaking. The system will simplify the irrigation process and allow crops to get the correct amount of water needed. 

The project involved setting up a gateway and binding Bannner Engineering's wireless conntroller to the gateway. The wireless controller would need to be programed inside of Banner's DXM software and pairing that with Ignition Prespective. The wirless controller could also be used as a repeater to cover all areas of the farm. Once the boxes were binded and programmed, they could be deployed out into the field. This project is still ongoing and about half of the boxes have been deployed.
